### Question 1: What is Helm in Kubernetes, and why is it used?
Helm is a **package manager for Kubernetes**. It allows users to define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications easily. Helm packages Kubernetes manifests into reusable units called **charts**, which simplify deployment and version management.  

Key reasons to use Helm:
- Simplifies deployment with preconfigured templates.
- Allows version-controlled application releases (via Helm releases).
- Supports upgrades, rollbacks, and easy configuration overrides.

***

### Question 2: What is a Helm chart, and what are its main components?
A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. Charts define the structure of an application and allow parameterized deployments.

Main components of a Helm chart:
- **Chart.yaml** – Metadata about the chart (name, version, description).
- **templates/** – Template files (e.g., Deployment, Service, ConfigMap).
- **values.yaml** – Default configuration values for templates.
- **charts/** – Subcharts (dependencies).
- **README.md** – Documentation for the chart (optional).
- **NOTES.txt** – Instructions displayed after installation.

***

### Question 3: How do you install, upgrade, and rollback a release in Helm?

**Install a release:**
```bash
helm install my-release my-chart/
```

**Upgrade a release:**
```bash
helm upgrade my-release my-chart/
```

**Rollback a release:**
```bash
helm rollback my-release 1
```

Here, `1` refers to the previous revision number.

***

### Question 4: What are Helm values, and how can you override them?
Helm values are configuration parameters passed to chart templates. They allow customization of deployments without modifying chart templates.

Ways to override Helm values:
1. Using the `--set` flag:
   ```bash
   helm install my-release my-chart/ --set replicaCount=3
   ```
2. Using a custom `values.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   helm install my-release my-chart/ -f custom-values.yaml
   ```
3. Combining both:
   ```bash
   helm install my-release my-chart/ -f custom-values.yaml --set image.tag=v2
   ```

***

### Question 5: How does Helm handle dependencies between charts?
Helm supports dependencies using the **Chart.yaml** or **requirements.yaml** files.

- Dependencies are declared in `Chart.yaml` under the `dependencies` section.
- Subcharts are placed in the `charts/` directory.
- Helm automatically pulls and manages dependent charts.

Example in `Chart.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: mysql
    version: 8.8.0
    repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

To update dependencies:
```bash
helm dependency update
```

***

### Question 6: What is Helm's values.yaml file used for, and why is it important?
The `values.yaml` file provides **default configuration values** for a chart. It is important because:
- It defines reusable configuration defaults.
- It minimizes hardcoding in templates.
- Users can override defaults with custom configuration files or `--set`.

Example:
```yaml
replicaCount: 2
image:
  repository: nginx
  tag: "1.21"
```

***

### Question 7: Explain how Helm uses templates and Go templating in chart files.
Helm uses the **Go templating engine** to dynamically generate Kubernetes manifests from chart templates.  

- Templates are written in YAML with Go template syntax (`{{ }}`).
- Values from `values.yaml` (and user overrides) are injected into templates.
- Functions, pipelines, and conditionals can be used.

Example in `deployment.yaml`:
```yaml
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
```

***

### Question 8: What are Helm hooks, and how can they be used?
Helm hooks are special annotations that allow you to intervene at different lifecycle events of a release. They can be used to run jobs such as database migrations.

Common hooks:
- `pre-install`
- `post-install`
- `pre-upgrade`
- `post-delete`

Example use case: Run a pre-install migration job
```yaml
annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
```

***

### Question 9: How would you use Helm to deploy the same application to multiple environments (dev, staging, production) with different configurations?
You can create separate `values.yaml` files for each environment:

- `values-dev.yaml`
- `values-staging.yaml`
- `values-prod.yaml`

Deploy the same chart with different configurations:
```bash
helm install myapp ./mychart -f values-dev.yaml
helm install myapp-staging ./mychart -f values-staging.yaml
helm install myapp-prod ./mychart -f values-prod.yaml
```

This ensures the same application structure but custom settings per environment.

***

### Question 10: What are some common troubleshooting steps when a Helm deployment fails?
- Check Helm release status:
  ```bash
  helm status my-release
  ```
- Get list of all releases:
  ```bash
  helm list -A
  ```
- Inspect rendered manifests:
  ```bash
  helm get manifest my-release
  ```
- View Helm logs:
  ```bash
  helm history my-release
  ```
- Debug with dry run:
  ```bash
  helm install --dry-run --debug my-release my-chart/
  ```
- Check Kubernetes events/pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```
